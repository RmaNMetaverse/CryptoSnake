Crypto Snake
A classic snake game with a volatile twist! The speed of the snake is directly tied to the real-time transaction per second (TPS) rate of the Bitcoin blockchain. As the network gets busier, the game gets faster, creating an unpredictable and challenging experience.

Mobile: Swipe up, down, left, or right to control the snake.

Eat the Bitcoin symbols (₿) to score points and make your snake grow longer. Keep an eye on the Speed Multiplier—it's based on live network data and can change at any moment!
